This repository explains how to select the best radius for ALS patients for 11 different features: citrus groves, orchards, irrigated areas, non-irrigated areas, vegetable gardens, meadows, rice fields, arable land, nurseries, vineyards, and olive groves provided in the statistical data. It consists of 2844 patients with a unique identification number, where each patient&#39;s row includes several sub-features of radius ranging from 100 to 2000 for each feature.
The goal is to draw the statistical description of each sub-feature to choose the best one. For this purpose, we considered only the most important factors, namely mean value, variance and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The first two factors need not be explained, however, in terms of calculating SNR, we used another dataset in which the post code of each patient is provided. To put it clearly, we first found
the patients of each post code and merged the two datasets with the id of each patient and finally calculated the SNR with the following equation: where is the variance among different postcodes, is the variance within one postcode and the sample size is the number of patients. The result of this equation is a matrix of size equal to () where the average SNR for each sub-feature is finally considered. This process was applied to all features in the dataset, and the result of the statistical description was shown in a multiple graph for each feature, as shown below (The titles are in Italian language)
